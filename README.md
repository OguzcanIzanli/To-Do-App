# To-Do List App

This project is a simple to-do list application built using React. It allows users to create, edit, and delete to-do list items. The application integrates a mock API to simulate backend functionality for storing and retrieving to-do list data. Users can access their to-do lists by entering their name on the login screen.

## Features

- **Mock API Integration:** Simulated backend functionality using a mock API for storing and retrieving to-do list data.
- **Context API:** State management using React's Context API to handle global state, such as user data and theme.
- **Custom Hooks:** Custom useFetch hook, encapsulate logic for fetching data from the mock API, promoting code reuse and modularity.
- **To-Do List** Functionality: Users can add, edit, and delete to-do list items, as well as mark items as completed.
- **Responsive Design:** Responsive layout ensures a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
